# CryptoClustering
Data was taken from the crypto_market_data.csv and used within Crypto_Clustering.ipynb.
The code within the ipynb does the following:

. Normalizes the csv file using StandardScaler module from scikit-learn and puts it in a pandas DataFrame

. Finds the Best Value for k Using the elbow method on the scaled DataFrame

. Clusters Cryptocurrencies with KMeans from sklearn using the scaled DataFrame and plots the clusters in scatter plot

. Perform Principal Component Analysis on the coin market data and creates a new DataFrame withe PCA data

. Finds the Best Value for k Using the elbow method on the pca DataFrame

. Clusters Cryptocurrencies with KMeans from sklearn using the pca DataFrame and plots the clusters in scatter plot

. Creates composite plots comparing the KMeans model predictions before and after PCA
